# A Study of the Data Provided by the Donors Choose Organization 
by
Steve Henle
Hazel John
Jim Schlough

## Overview and Motivation: 
*Provide an overview of the project goals and the motivation for it. Consider that this will be read by people who did not see your project proposal.*
Funding the contemporary K-12 classroom is greatly challenging and many teachers believe that resources provided are insufficient in meeting the most basic objectives. Nontraditional support is playing an increasingly important part in supporting the modern classroom. 

The Donors Choose web platform provides a mechanism of providing support to teachers by benefactors. A potential donor may read an appeal written by a teacher to fulfill a specific classroom material need, and donates towards their funding goal. If the funding goal is met, these materials are sourced by fulfillment sources under the control of the Donors Choose organization, and sent directly to the school. 

Given the changes in public sentiments and commitments towards financial support of the community school over the past few decades, the ability to raise funds directly into the classroom might come to be considered a vital skill of the teacher in supporting classroom activities. 

When written appeals succeed by becoming fully funded, or fail by expiring, the data surrounding the appeal is gathered and made publicly available. By analyzing this data, it might be possible to better understand the factors correlated with success or failure of a written appeal. Some factors such as location, date and time, and poverty level are beyond the control of a teacher. Other factors, such as the written content of an appeal, or to a lesser extent, the credentials of the teacher, can be controlled. 

We wish to apply statistical analysis of the available data in an effort to go beyond axiomatic and aesthetic beliefs regarding what makes a more or less effective funding proposal. 


## Related Work: 
*Anything that inspired you, such as a paper, a web site, or something we discussed in class.*
Jim's sister is a grade school art teacher who successfully funded a 3D printer for her classroom. On last report, the best expert for this printer is a female 4th grader.

Steve writes grant proposals, so it is interesting to understand what makes a good grant proposal by way of a data analysis.

Hazel works with her marketing department on content marketing, personalization etc. She in interested in understanding what motivates prospects to become customers, in this case prospects becomes benefactors.

Stephen Colbert made the news in 2015 [by funding every teacher's proposal for the State of South Carolina](http://time.com/3850694/stephen-colbert-funds-every-teacher-requested-grant-in-south-carolina-schools/). This did rise the national profile of Donors Choose, not only helping all the teachers in South Carolina, but also giving much needed publicity to this cause.
 



## Initial Questions: 
*What questions are you trying to answer? How did these questions evolve over the course of the project? What new questions did you consider in the course of your analysis?*
*What makes the difference between a proposal that is funded and one that expires? 
*Which are the winning qualities? 
*Of the predicting qualities, are there any that are under the control of the writer?
*Does the content of the written essay matter?

## Data: 
*Source, scraping method, cleanup, etc.*
We are using the data made publicly available on the Donors Choose website.
This data can be found at [here](http://data.donorschoose.org/open-data/overview/).

This is a suggested schema for the recomposition of their open dataset:

### Data Wrangling

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Load required libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)
library(readr)
library(lubridate)
library(tidytext)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(stringr)
library(reshape2)
library(wordcloud)
theme_set(theme_bw(base_size = 16))
```


#### Step 1: Data Download & Cleanup

Our first task was to download the data, clean it up and extract the data we needed. We decided to do the analysis with just the data from 2014, so the final task was the filter out unneeded data.

We also saved the final data sets to submit as part of the project.

This is only run once and not evaluated after that since we can read data from the filtered data files directly.

```{r, eval=FALSE}

# Create function to write data frame to zipped rds file
# The dataframe is split into smaller files depending on size
writeToDisk <- function(df, path) {
  # get the size of the data frame
  filesz = object.size(df)
  
  # Figure out if it needs to be split, we try to 
  # split into sizes ~ 250MB (before compression)
  numsplits = filesz %/% (150*1024*1024)
  
  # Split into subsets and write to disk in RDS format
  # so that we can preserve attritubes including type
  if (numsplits > 1) {
    # Split the dataframe into "numsplits" subsets
    df_split <- split(df, ntile(df$`_projectid`, numsplits))
    
    cat("Writing", numsplits, "files with prefix", path, "\n")
    
    # Save data to separate rds files
    # Wrap loop inside invisible() since we are not interested in
    # the return values
    invisible(lapply(names(df_split), function(x) {
      
      write_rds(df_split[[x]], paste0(path, x, "of", numsplits, ".rds.gz"),
                compress = "gz")
    }))
  }
  else {
    
    cat("Writing 1 file with prefix", path, "\n")
    write_rds(df, paste0(path, ".rds.gz"), compress = "gz")
  }
}

# Create function that download file of type "kind", removes special 
# characters and loads the data
retrieveData <- function(kind, needs_cleanup) {
  
  # Create the download link
  url <- paste0("https://s3.amazonaws.com/open_data/csv/opendata_",
                  kind, ".zip")
     
  # Create the path to download the file to           
  zipname <- paste0("data/opendata_", kind, ".zip")
  
  # Create the filename
  filename <- paste0("opendata_", kind, ".csv")
  
  cat("Downloading from", url, "...")
  
  # Download the file
  download.file(url, zipname)
  
  # Donations, resources and essays data files needed cleanup with
  # special characters, escaped characters etc. creating read errors.
  # Data cleanup was done using sed as a system call after
  # realizing that using pipe() to run sed from R was slow.
  # NOTE: The sed script was created on MacOS and might not be portable.
  # Tried to run sed inside pipe - scan(pipe(sed_cmd), sep = ",") 
  # but had too many issues with needing to use multiple escaped characters
  # Also tried readlines() followed by gsub() but the performance was poor.
  if (needs_cleanup) {
    # cleanup is needed so unzip, run sed and then read in data
    
    # unzip the file
    unzip(zipname, filename)
    
    # Create a sed command to clean out special characters
    sed_cmd <- paste0("sed -i '' -f ", kind,
                      "_clnup.sed ", filename)
    
    cat("Running data cleanup for", filename, "...")
    
    # Run the sed command
    system(sed_cmd)
    
    cat("Loading", kind, "...")
    
    # Read in the data
    assign(kind, read_csv(filename), envir=globalenv())
    
    # Remove files
    unlink(zipname)
    unlink(filename)
  }
  else {
    cat("Loading", kind, "...")
    
    # cleanup is not needed, so read in data directly
    assign(kind, read_csv(unz(zipname, filename)), envir=globalenv())

    # Remove zip file
    unlink(zipname)
  }
}

# Create the list the type of data files we want to download
types_list = c("projects", "resources", "donations", "essays")
  
# Note which files need cleanup
needs_cleanup = c(FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE)

# Download files, remove special characters and load data
for (index in seq(1:4)) {
  retrieveData(types_list[index], needs_cleanup[index])
}

# Convert dates to "Date" format
projects <- projects %>%
  mutate(date_posted = as_date(date_posted),
         date_completed = as_date(date_completed),
         date_thank_you_packet_mailed =
           as_date(date_thank_you_packet_mailed),
         date_expiration = as_date(date_expiration))

donations <- donations %>%
  mutate(donation_timestamp = as_date(donation_timestamp))

# Filter out projects that were posted in 2014
projects <- projects %>% filter(year(date_posted) == 2014)

# Select resources, donations and essays associated with
# 
resources <- resources %>%
  semi_join(projects, by = "_projectid")
donations <- donations %>%
  semi_join(projects, by = "_projectid")
essays <- essays %>%
  semi_join(projects, by = "_projectid")

# Save filtered data to disk
writeToDisk(df=projects, path="data/opendata_2014_projects")
writeToDisk(df=resources, path="data/opendata_2014_resources")
writeToDisk(df=donations, path="data/opendata_2014_donations")
writeToDisk(df=essays, path="data/opendata_2014_essays")

# Let us clean all the variables so as to be able to start 
# with a clean slate
rm(projects, resources, donations, essays, 
   types_list, needs_cleanup, retrieveData, writeToDisk)

# Cleanup memory
gc()
```


#### Step 2: Data Upload from disk

This is where we would start after the initial data retrieval. We need to load the data from the RDS files in the data folder

```{r, warning=FALSE}

# Create function to load data from the rds files containing the
# name "kind".
uploadData <- function(kind) {
  temp <- list.files(path = "./data", 
                    pattern = paste0(".*", kind, ".*rds.gz"),
                    full.names = TRUE)
  # Read in the data
  tables <- lapply(temp, read_rds)
  
  # Combine multiple (or single) dataframes into one and return
  return (bind_rows(tables))
}

# Read in the different data sets
projects <- uploadData("projects")
resources <- uploadData("resources")
donations <- uploadData("donations")
essays <- uploadData("essays")

# dplyr wants us the put column names in back-quotes when the name
# starts with "_". The quotes however causes errors with knitting 
# So remove all the "_" in the column names 
names(projects) <- gsub("^_", "", names(projects))
names(resources) <- gsub("^_", "", names(resources))
names(donations) <- gsub("^_", "", names(donations))
names(essays) <- gsub("^_", "", names(essays))

```

#### Text Analysis 


```{r, warning=FALSE}

# Tokenize the essay and remove stop words and include only
# all alphabetic words. All words are lower case, so there is
# no need to transform
essays_tokenized <- essays %>%
  select(projectid, teacherid, essay) %>%
  unnest_tokens(essay_words,essay)  %>%
  filter(!essay_words %in% stop_words$word &
           grepl("^[[:alpha:]]*$", essay_words))

# Get the sentiment lexicon from mrc
nrc <- sentiments %>%
  filter(lexicon == "nrc") %>%
  select(word, sentiment)

# Assign sentiments to words
essays_sentiments <- essays_tokenized %>%
  left_join(nrc, by = c("essay_words" = "word"))

# Include the funding_status of the projects
essays_sentiments <- essays_sentiments %>%
  left_join(projects, by = "projectid") %>%
  select(projectid, funding_status, essay_words, sentiment)

# Count the sentiment frequency
essays_sentiment_freq <-
  essays_sentiments %>%

        legend.key.size = unit(0.5, "cm"),
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) +
  ggtitle('Sentiment Occurance% in Funding Essays') +
  coord_flip()

# Compute word frequency in essays regardless of sentiment
# or funding_status
essays_word_freq <-
  essays_sentiments %>%
  group_by(essay_words) %>%
  summarise(completed_freq = sum(funding_status == "completed"),
            expired_freq = sum(funding_status == "expired"))

# Plot the top 10 words for both funding status
p1 <- essays_word_freq %>%
  top_n(n=10, wt=completed_freq) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=reorder(essay_words, completed_freq),
             y = log10(completed_freq))) +

  ggtitle('Top 10 Words (completed)') +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 8),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 10),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 10)) +
  xlab("essay_words") +
  coord_flip()

p2 <- essays_word_freq %>%
  top_n(n=10, wt=expired_freq) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=reorder(essay_words, expired_freq), 
             y = log10(expired_freq))) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity",  fill = "green") +
  ggtitle('Top 10 Words (expired)') +

        axis.title = element_text(size = 10),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 10)) +
  xlab("essay_words") +
  coord_flip()

grid.arrange(p1, p2, nrow=1)

# Students stands out for both "completed" and "expired" projects,
# So create word clouds without it, to see the rest better
essays_word_freq <- essays_word_freq %>%
  filter(essay_words != "students")

# Create word cloud for funded essays
wordcloud(essays_word_freq$essay_words, essays_word_freq$completed_freq,
          min.freq = 10000, max.words=100, random.order=TRUE,
          rot.per=0.35, colors=brewer.pal(8, "Dark2"))


# Create word cloud for expired essays
wordcloud(essays_word_freq$essay_words, essays_word_freq$expired_freq,
          min.freq = 10000, max.words=100, random.order=TRUE,
          rot.per=0.35, colors=brewer.pal(8, "Dark2"))
