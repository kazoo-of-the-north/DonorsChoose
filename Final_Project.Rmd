# A Study of the Data Provided by the Donors Choose Organization 
by

## Overview and Motivation
Funding the contemporary K-12 classroom is greatly challenging and many teachers believe that resources provided are insufficient in meeting the most basic objectives. Nontraditional support is playing an increasingly important part in supporting the modern classroom. 

The Donors Choose web platform provides a mechanism of providing support to teachers by benefactors. A potential donor may read an appeal written by a teacher to fulfill a specific classroom material need, and donates towards their funding goal. If the funding goal is met, these materials are sourced by fulfillment sources under the control of the Donors Choose organization, and sent directly to the school. 

Given the changes in public sentiments and commitments towards financial support of the community school over the past few decades, the ability to raise funds directly into the classroom might come to be considered a vital skill of the teacher in supporting classroom activities. 

When written appeals succeed by becoming fully funded, or fail by expiring, the data surrounding the appeal is gathered and made publicly available. By analyzing this data, it might be possible to better understand the factors correlated with success or failure of a written appeal. Some factors such as location, date and time, and poverty level are beyond the control of a teacher. Other factors, such as the written content of an appeal, or to a lesser extent, the credentials of the teacher, can be controlled. 

We wish to apply statistical analysis of the available data in an effort to go beyond axiomatic and aesthetic beliefs regarding what makes a more or less effective funding proposal.

## Related Work
Jim's sister is a grade school art teacher who successfully funded a 3D printer for her classroom. On last report, the best expert for this printer is a female 4th grader.

Steve writes grant proposals, so it is interesting to understand what makes a good grant proposal by way of a data analysis.

Hazel works with her marketing department on content marketing, personalization etc. She in interested in understanding what motivates prospects to become customers. In this case we analyze factors that encourage prospects to turn into benefactors.

Stephen Colbert made the news in 2015 [by funding every teacher's proposal for the State of South Carolina](http://time.com/3850694/stephen-colbert-funds-every-teacher-requested-grant-in-south-carolina-schools/). This did rise the national profile of Donors Choose, not only helping all the teachers in South Carolina, but also giving much needed publicity to this cause.

## Initial Questions
We set forth to answer the following questions regarding the funding proposals for Donors Choose.

*What makes the difference between a proposal that is funded and one that expires?<br> 
*Which are the winning qualities? <br>
*Of the predicting qualities, are there any that are under the control of the writer?<br>
*Does the content of the written essay matter?<br>

## Data
We are using the data made publicly available on the Donors Choose website. This publicly available comes in the form of downloadable csv files, ranging in size from megabytes to gigabytes.
This data can be found at [here](http://data.donorschoose.org/open-data/overview/).

The proposals are one element in the open data set published from the Donors Choose web site. An image of the schema showing the suggested recomposition is in <a href="#csv_recomposition">Appendix B</a>, below, and can also be found at Donors Choose.

#### Step 1: Data Download & Cleanup

Our first task was to download the data, clean it up and extract the data we needed. We decided to do the analysis with just the data from 2014, so the final task was the filter out unneeded data.

#### rm_old: Our First Data Wrangling Utility 

Our first plan was to use a combination of AWK and SED to do the necessary data cleanup, but time & date fields proved to be problematic. After an evening of steady efforts along those lines, a C++ data cleaning application was written as a stop gap measure. This C++ data cleaner provided a temporary means to separate the 2014 projects records from the csv file and get the rest of the team started with the data. The source code for the intermediate c++ application, was named rm_old and its source code can be found <a href="#rm_old">here in Appendix A</a>.

### Data Wrangling in R

During analysis of the data files retrieved from the Donor's Choose website, we noticed that it contained string fields with special characters that caused errors when using the standard read utilities for comma delimited files. The first plan was to read files line by line and use "gsub" to removed unnecessary characters, but this turned out very slow. We then tried to run the UNIX utility "sed" within the "pipe" function, but the special characters like ctrl-M made that problematic. The final iteration still used "sed" by was run as a system call from R. Each file required slight variations in the search patterns so different <datatype>_clnup.sed scripts were created for each. 

Our final data wrangling consisted of the following steps:

* Data download from the website, 
* Cleanup via "sed" with a  system call
* Extraction of CSV as a dataframe
* Filtering out projects not posted in 2014
* Storing cleaned dataframes as RDS files


```{r eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# Create function to write data frame to zipped rds file
# The dataframe is split into smaller files depending on size
writeToDisk <- function(df, path) {
  # get the size of the data frame
  filesz = object.size(df)
  
  # Figure out if it needs to be split, we try to 
  # split into sizes ~ 250MB (before compression)
  numsplits = filesz %/% (150*1024*1024)
  
  # Split into subsets and write to disk in RDS format
  # so that we can preserve attritubes including type
  if (numsplits > 1) {
    # Split the dataframe into "numsplits" subsets
    df_split <- split(df, ntile(df$`_projectid`, numsplits))
    
    cat("Writing", numsplits, "files with prefix", path, "\n")
    
    # Save data to separate rds files
    # Wrap loop inside invisible() since we are not interested in
    # the return values
    invisible(lapply(names(df_split), function(x) {
      
      write_rds(df_split[[x]], paste0(path, x, "of", numsplits, ".rds.gz"),
                compress = "gz")
    }))
  }
  else {
    
    cat("Writing 1 file with prefix", path, "\n")
    write_rds(df, paste0(path, ".rds.gz"), compress = "gz")
  }

# characters and loads the data
retrieveData <- function(kind, needs_cleanup) {
  
  # Create the download link

                  kind, ".zip")

  # NOTE: The sed script was created on MacOS and might not be portable.
  # Tried to run sed inside pipe - scan(pipe(sed_cmd), sep = ",") 
  # but had too many issues with needing to use multiple escaped characters
  # Also tried readlines() followed by gsub() but the performance was poor.
  if (needs_cleanup) {
    # cleanup is needed so unzip, run sed and then read in data

# Note which files need cleanup
needs_cleanup = c(FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE)

# Download files, remove special characters and load data
for (index in seq(1:4)) {
  retrieveData(types_list[index], needs_cleanup[index])
}

# Convert dates to "Date" format
projects <- projects %>%
  mutate(date_posted = as_date(date_posted),
         date_completed = as_date(date_completed),
         date_thank_you_packet_mailed =
           as_date(date_thank_you_packet_mailed),
         date_expiration = as_date(date_expiration))

donations <- donations %>%
  mutate(donation_timestamp = as_date(donation_timestamp))

# Filter out projects that were posted in 2014
projects <- projects %>% filter(year(date_posted) == 2014)

# Select resources, donations and essays associated with
# 
resources <- resources %>%
  semi_join(projects, by = "_projectid")
donations <- donations %>%
  semi_join(projects, by = "_projectid")
essays <- essays %>%
  semi_join(projects, by = "_projectid")

# Save filtered data to disk
writeToDisk(df=projects, path="data/opendata_2014_projects")
writeToDisk(df=resources, path="data/opendata_2014_resources")
writeToDisk(df=donations, path="data/opendata_2014_donations")
writeToDisk(df=essays, path="data/opendata_2014_essays")

# Let us clean all the variables so as to be able to start 
# with a clean slate
rm(projects, resources, donations, essays, 
   types_list, needs_cleanup, retrieveData, writeToDisk)

# Cleanup memory
gc()
```

#### Step 2: Data Upload from disk

A simple function was written to upload the cleaned data from RDS files stored on disk.  All data exploration and analysis was run on the uploaded data.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

# Create function to load data from the rds files containing the
# name "kind".
uploadData <- function(kind) {
  temp <- list.files(path = "./data", 
                    pattern = paste0(".*", kind, ".*rds.gz"),
                    full.names = TRUE)
  # Read in the data
  tables <- lapply(temp, read_rds)
  
  # Combine multiple (or single) dataframes into one and return
  return (bind_rows(tables))
}

# Read in the different data sets
projects <- uploadData("projects")
resources <- uploadData("resources")
donations <- uploadData("donations")
essays <- uploadData("essays")

```

## Exploratory Analysis
We began an exploration of the data to see what relationships might be discovered within it, to compare the completed and expired projects.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

#add column to project df called percent_funded that tells the percent money given over asked for
projects <- projects %>% mutate(percent_funded = (total_donations / total_price_including_optional_support))

#test for normalacy of percent funded
hist(projects$percent_funded)
qqnorm(projects$percent_funded)
print("Data is nowhere near normal, looks like logistic analysis of funded vs non-funded make much more sense.")

print("Will not look at different factors contained in the projects file to determine if they affect the likliehood of getting funded. There are techinically three outcomes for each request. Complete, means reached or succeeded funding goal. Expired, time ran out wihtout reaching goal. Reallocated, Did not reach goal, but donors chose to give previously pledge amount to a different proposal.")

#### Building a Prediction Model for Proposal Success

The first attempt to build a model was to use the glm method in the train function and select several variables from the earlier exploratory analysis that looked to have an effect. These variables included: amount of money asked for, school state, primary focus, primary subject, resource type, date posted. We used glm because our outcome is either funded or not funded and glm works well for logistic regression.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
#create column for binary 1 = funded, 0 = not funded regression
projects <- projects %>% mutate(funded = ifelse(funding_status == "completed", 1 , 0))

fit_selected_components <- train(funded ~ total_price_excluding_optional_support + primary_focus_area + school_charter + primary_focus_subject + students_reached + school_state + resource_type + date_posted,  data=projects, method="glm", family="binomial")

fit_selected_components

```

The RMSE from this method is not great, but it is a start so we tried to improve on it. First we filtered out some of the uncommon variables, that appeared to have an effect in the exploratory analysis. For example if the teacher was in teacher in teach for America, a New York teach fellow, was it a charter school, or other school types. All total these only filtered out few percent of the applications, and are factors the requesters can't change so they are not useful in building a prediction model. We then ran the training again.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

#fliter out less used variables
projects2 <- projects %>% filter(school_year_round == 'f'& school_magnet == 'f'& school_charter == 'f'& school_nlns == 'f'& school_kipp == 'f'& school_charter_ready_promise == 'f'& teacher_teach_for_america == 'f'& teacher_ny_teaching_fellow == 'f')

#run train again
fit_selected_components_filtered <- train(funded ~ total_price_excluding_optional_support + primary_focus_area + primary_focus_subject + students_reached + school_state + resource_type + date_posted,  data=projects2, method="glm", family="binomial")

fit_selected_components_filtered

```

Removing these proposals did show an effect in an improvement of RMSE, even though it is . The next approach was that perhaps our model was trying to fit to many parameters, so we pared it down to only include the factors that the exploratory analysis showed to have the greatest effect. These factors were: cost, date of posting, and resource type.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
#run train again using most selective variables
fit_more_selective_components <- train(funded ~ total_price_excluding_optional_support +  date_posted + resource_type,  data=projects2, method="glm", family="binomial")

fit_more_selective_components

```

This shows an even greater improvement in RMSE. In looking back at the data it was clear that the cost requested has the strongest effect. So we decided to run train again to see if that variable alone might improve our accurary (as shown by RMSE).


```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
fit_cost_only <- train(funded ~ total_price_excluding_optional_support,  data=projects2, method="glm", family="binomial")

fit_cost_only

```

So using all the data, except the contents of the essay, provided by the requesters it appears that the best model we can build is using the total cost as a predictor.

#### Text Analysis  

##### Word Selection Analysis

As part of the data available from the DonorsChoose website, we were able to download the full text of the teacher-written requests accompanying all classroom projects. The heart of each teacher’s classroom project request is their written request, and we wanted to use text mining to see if we could extract information from the essays to predict which projects get funded. The two questions we chose to answer were:

* Does the sentiments expressed in the essay help predict whether it gets funded completed or not?
* Are there specific words that appear in the essays for projects that are fully funded, that don't appear in the incompletely funded ones?

**Sentiment Analysis**

 We started by tokenizing the essay words and then using the sentiment lexicon from "nrc" to assign sentiments to the words. We then computed the percentage occurance for the sentiments in essays grouped by the funding status of the projects and compared.
 
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

# Tokenize the essay and remove stop words and include only
# all alphabetic words. All words are lower case, so there is
# no need to transform
essays_tokenized <- essays %>%
  select(`_projectid`, `_teacherid`, essay) %>%
  unnest_tokens(essay_words,essay)  %>%
  filter(!essay_words %in% stop_words$word &
           grepl("^[[:alpha:]]*$", essay_words))

# Get the sentiment lexicon from mrc
nrc <- sentiments %>%
  filter(lexicon == "nrc") %>%
  select(word, sentiment)

# Assign sentiments to words
essays_sentiments <- essays_tokenized %>%
  left_join(nrc, by = c("essay_words" = "word"))

# Include the funding_status of the projects
essays_sentiments <- essays_sentiments %>%
  left_join(projects, by = "_projectid") %>%
  select(`_projectid`, funding_status, essay_words, sentiment)

# Count the sentiment occurance percentage
essays_sentiment_freq <-
  essays_sentiments %>%
  group_by(funding_status, sentiment) %>%
  summarise(sentiment_freq = n()) %>%
  group_by(funding_status) %>%
  mutate(occurance_pct = sentiment_freq*100/sum(sentiment_freq)) %>%
  ungroup()


# Plot the sentiment frequency and seperate by funding status
essays_sentiment_freq %>%
  filter(funding_status != "reallocated") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=sentiment, y = occurance_pct, fill = sentiment)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  facet_grid(~funding_status) +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 10),
        title = element_text(size = 12),
        legend.key.size = unit(0.5, "cm"),
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) +
  ggtitle('Sentiment Occurance% in Funding Essays') +
  coord_flip()
```

We can see from the graph that both positive and negitive sentiments occur at an almost identical rate completed funded as well as expired projects. We can see the minor differences more clearly in the data frame.

```{r warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
temp <- essays_sentiment_freq %>% 
        filter(funding_status != "reallocated") %>% 
        select(sentiment, funding_status, occurance_pct) %>%
        spread(funding_status, occurance_pct)
print(temp)
rm(temp)
```

**Word Analysis**

We then analyzed the occurance of specific words in the essays for insights. We started by looking at the top 10 words for both fully funded and expired projects.
 
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# Compute word frequency in essays regardless of sentiment
# or funding_status
essays_word_freq <-
  essays_sentiments %>%
  group_by(essay_words) %>%
  summarise(completed_freq = sum(funding_status == "completed"),
            expired_freq = sum(funding_status == "expired"))

# Plot the top 10 words for both funding status
p1 <- essays_word_freq %>%
  top_n(n=10, wt=completed_freq) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=reorder(essay_words, completed_freq),
             y = log10(completed_freq))) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", fill = "blue") +
  ggtitle('Top 10 Words (completed)') +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 8),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 10),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 10)) +
  xlab("essay_words") +
  coord_flip()

p2 <- essays_word_freq %>%
  top_n(n=10, wt=expired_freq) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=reorder(essay_words, expired_freq), 
             y = log10(expired_freq))) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity",  fill = "green") +
  ggtitle('Top 10 Words (expired)') +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 8),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 10),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 10)) +
  xlab("essay_words") +
  coord_flip()

grid.arrange(p1, p2, nrow=1)
```

The top 10 words for both categories were almost identical. The only thing that stood out a little was that "excited" was in the top ten for completed funded projects versus "technology" for expired projects. This could be related to the fact that technology is more expensive and thus there is a lower chance of the project getting fully funded.

We removed the common words for both project categories for the top 10 words to focus of the rest of the words.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# Students stands out for both "completed" and "expired" projects,
# So create word clouds without it, to see the rest better
essays_word_freq <- essays_word_freq %>%
  filter(!essay_words %in% c("students", "school", "teach", 
                             "learning", "classroom", "love",
                             "reading", "learn", "art"))
```

We then used wordclouds to compare the words that occur the most in both funding categories. We started with high frequency words in essays for projects that were fully funded.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, rfig.cap="Wordcloud for \"completed\" project essays"}

# Create word cloud for funded essays
wordcloud(essays_word_freq$essay_words, essays_word_freq$completed_freq,
          min.freq = 20000, max.words=75, random.order=TRUE,
          rot.per=0.35, colors=brewer.pal(8, "Dark2"))
```

Then we compared it with the high frequency words in essays for projects that expired and weren't fully funded.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, rfig.cap="Wordcloud for \"expired\" project essays"}
# Create word cloud for expired essays
wordcloud(essays_word_freq$essay_words, essays_word_freq$expired_freq,
          min.freq = 20000, max.words=75, random.order=TRUE,
          rot.per=0.35, colors=brewer.pal(8, "Dark2"))

```

Looking at the wordcloud, one of the things that stood out were the higher relative prominence of "books" for funded projects versus "technology" for expired projects.

##### Essay word count comparison results 
Does essay word count matter?

Here we look at the number of words in essays, to see if there is any significant difference between the number of words in completed and expired essays.

```{r Essay word count comparison results, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# Does essay word count matter?

# sprintf("For the year 2014, from a total of %d essays: ", count(completed_projects)$n, count(expired_projects)$n)
# sprintf("%d essays were from completed projects and %d essays were from expired projects. ", count(projects)$n, count(completed_projects)$n, count(expired_projects)$n)
# sprintf("All essays had a mean length of %3.4f and a standard deviation of %3.4f", mean(essay_total_word_sums$word_count), sd(essay_total_word_sums$word_count))
# sprintf("Completed essays had a mean length of %3.4f and a standard deviation of %3.4f", mean(completed_total_word_sums$word_count), sd(completed_total_word_sums$word_count))
# sprintf("Expired essays had a mean length of %3.4f and a standard deviation of %3.4f", mean(expd_total_word_sums$word_count), sd(expd_total_word_sums$word_count))
sprintf("On average, completed essays had essay word counts that were %3.4f %s than expired ones", abs(mean(completed_total_word_sums$word_count) - mean(expd_total_word_sums$word_count)), ifelse(mean(completed_total_word_sums$word_count) > mean(expd_total_word_sums$word_count), "longer", "shorter" ))

```
The length of essay, in terms of word count, does not seem to matter much all by itself.

## Final Analysis
After examining the data, we were able to draw some conclusions.
Of all of the predictors, the total project cost was found to the be most significant.
